How to use
----------
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/davidrayoussef/full-screen-gif-slider.git
$ cd full-screen-gif-slider
```
- Add a folder of gifs (make sure the folder is called "gifs" ... all lowercase, no quotes)
- Push or upload to a server that runs PHP
- For best results...
  * only use horizontal, landscape images, since the images stretch to fit the screen. Vertical images will get distorted.
  * try to keep the filesizes under 1 meg, so that they have time to load and animate
